## Day 12 (October 10th, 5:30pm-07:00pm IST)
* Topics:
  * Basics of observations and galaxy evolution - [recorded lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCW8JHS5NjI)
    
    Abstract: Don't we all like to thoroughly know our home? Or our city, state, or country, where we belong? The same applies for our Galaxy. It is our home. We would like to understand it well. But unlike our homes, we didn't build our galaxy, nor do we have a historical record of how our galaxy came to be what it is today. In order understand the evolution of our home Galaxy, we need to study other galaxies. We need to go back in time. This is where observational astronomy comes into play. I will talk about the basics of observations relevant to studying galaxy evolution, including emission line spectroscopy and IFU data cubes. I hope to demonstrate the power of these simple observational tools in revealing the building blocks of life, far back in time, when the Universe was a baby. In the end, if we have time to jump back to the present, I will briefly discuss what part my own research plays in this vast field of galaxy evolution.

* Prerequisites:
  * Curiosity, and Class 11 physics background

* Resources:
  * [Presentation](https://github.com/ssp5361/Mini-Astro-workshop/blob/master/Day-12/Ayan_MAW_talk.pptx)
  * [Other public talks by Ayan](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~acharyya/outreach.html)

* Open-source codes/packages:
  * [enzo_model_code](https://github.com/ayanacharyya/enzo_model_code): code for generating PPV cubes
  * [SimSpin](https://github.com/kateharborne/SimSpin): A package for the kinematic analysis of galaxy simulations
     Description: The purpose of the Simspin R-package is to take a galaxy simulation and measure an the kinematics of that model as if it had been observed using                     an IFU. A kinematic data cube can be produced using the functions in this package; from this cube, "observables" can be measured.
