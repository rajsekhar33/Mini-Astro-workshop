    Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is the upcoming space borne laser interferometer to detect gravitational waves in mHz range. I will be talking about the orbit and the stabilization of the 3 space crafts. I will also be talking about its primary source which is Extreme Mass Ratio black hole Binaries. I will discuss what challenges lie ahead in modelling of Gravitational Wave sources for LISA and why discontinuous Galerkin method is a good candidate for the algorithm to be used.
